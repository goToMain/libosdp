# LibOSDP - Open Supervised Device Protocol Library

[![Version][1]][2] [![Build CI][3]][4]

This is an open source implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 Open Supervised Device
Protocol (OSDP). The protocol is intended to improve interoperability among
access control and security products. It supports Secure Channel (SC) for
encrypted and authenticated communication between configured devices.

OSDP describes the communication protocol for interfacing one or more Peripheral
Devices (PD) to a Control Panel (CP) over a two-wire RS-485 multi-drop serial
communication channel. Nevertheless, this protocol can be used to transfer
secure data over any stream based physical channel. Read more about OSDP
[here][21].

This protocol is developed and maintained by [Security Industry Association][20]
(SIA).

## Salient Features of LibOSDP

  - Supports secure channel communication (AES-128).
  - Can be used to setup a PD or CP mode of operation.
  - Exposes a well defined contract though a single header file.
  - No run-time memory allocation. All memory is allocated at init-time.
  - No external dependencies (for ease of cross compilation).
  - Fully non-blocking, asynchronous design.
  - Provides Python3 bindings for the C library for faster testing/integration.

## C API

LibOSDP exposes a [minimal set of API][26] to setup and manage the lifecycle of
OSDP devices. See `include/osdp.h` for more details.

## Python API

To setup a device as a Control Panel in Python, you'd do something like this:

```python
import osdp

## Setup OSDP device in Control Panel mode
cp = osdp.ControlPanel(pd_info, master_key=key)

## send a output command to PD-1
cp.send_command(1, output_cmd)
```

Similarly, for Peripheral Device,

```python
import osdp

## Setup OSDP device in Peripheral Device mode
pd = osdp.PeripheralDevice(pd_info, capabilities=pd_cap)

## Set a handler for incoming commands from CP
pd.set_command_callback(command_handler_fn)
```

For more details, look at [cp_app.py][29] and [pd_app.py][30].

## Supported Commands and Replies

OSDP has certain command and reply IDs pre-registered. This implementation of
the protocol support only the most common among them. You can see a list of
commands and replies and their support status in LibOSDP [here][22].

## Dependencies

  * [goToMain/C-Utils][25] (host, submodule)
  * cmake3 (host)
  * python3 (host, optional)
  * python3-pip (host, optional)
  * [doxygen][9] (host, optional; for building the html docs as seen [here][6])
  * [OpenSSL][8] (host and target, optional - recommended)
  * [MbedTLS][7] (host and target, optional)
  * [pytest][5] (host, optional; for running the integrated test suite)

### For ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install cmake python3 python3-pip python3-dev libssl-dev doxygen
```

## Compile LibOSDP

LibOSDP provides a lean-build that only builds the core library and nothing
else. This is useful if you are cross compiling as it doesn't have any other
dependencies but a C compiler. Here is an example of how you can cross compile
LibOSDP to `arm-none-eabi-gcc`.

```
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
export CCFLAGS=--specs=nosys.specs
./configure.sh
make
```

To build libosdp and all its components you must have cmake-3.0 (or above) and
a C compiler installed.  This repository produces a `libosdp.so` and
`libosdpstatic.a`; so depending on on your needs you can link these with -losdp
or -losdpstatic, respectively.

Have a look at `sample/* for a quick lookup on how to consume this library and
structure your application.

You can also read the [API documentation][26] for a comprehensive list of APIs
that are exposed by libosdp.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp --recurse-submodules
# git submodule update --init (if you missed doing --recurse-submodules earlier)
cd libosdp
./configure.sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Refer to [this document][23] for more information on build and cross
compilation.

### Run the test suite

LibOSDP uses the [pytest][5] python framework to test changes made to ensure
we aren't breaking existing functionalities while adding newer ones. You can
install pytest in your development machine with,

```sh
python3 -m pip install pytest
```

Running the tests locally before creating a pull request is recommended to make
sure that your changes aren't breaking any of the existing functionalities. Here
is how you can run them:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make python_install
make check
```

To add new tests for the feature you are working one, see the other tests in
`pytest` directory.

### Build HTML docs

This sections is for those who want to build the HTML documentation for this
project locally. The latest version of the doc can always be found at
[libosdp.gotomain.io][6].

Install the dependencies (one time) with,

```sh
pip3 install -r doc/requirements.txt
```

Build the docs by doing the following:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make html_docs # output in ./docs/sphinx/
```
