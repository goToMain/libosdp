Create/Manage/Control OSDP Devices
==================================

osdpctl is a tool that uses libosdp to setup/manage/control osdp devices. It
also serves as a starting point for those who intend to consume this library.
It cannot be used directly in applications as most of the time a lot more
product specific customizations are needed.

This tool brings in a concept called **channel** to describe the communication
between a CP and PD. Although OSDP defines this protocol to run on RS458
(serial), it is possible to run this over other mediums too. From a testing
perspective, running on a unix IPC channel is very convenient. To know
more about how this is achieved, look at ``channel_*.c`` files in this
directory.

Configuration files
-------------------

Since OSDP requires a lot of configuration information to setup a PD/CP, its
not practical to pass all of them from the command line (I tried). So the tool
uses a configuration file (ini format) to get the settings needed to configure
the OSDP library (libosdp). This file determines if the service is to run as a
CP or PD. You can read more about the configuration file and the various keys
it can contain in the `documentation section`_.

Some sample configuration files can be found inside the ``config/`` `directory`_.

Start / Stop a service
----------------------

An OSDP service can be started by passing a suitable config file to ``osdpctl``
tool. You can pass the ``-f`` flag to fork the process to background and the ``-l``
flag to log output to a file or ``-q`` to disable logging. So to start a OSDP
process as a daemon, you can do the following:

.. code:: bash

    osdpctl pd-0.cfg start -f -l /tmp/pd-0.log

To stop a running service, you must pass the same configuration file that was
used to start it.

.. code:: bash

    osdpctl pd-0.cfg stop

Send control commands to an OSDP service
---------------------------------------

A command to be sent to a running CP/PD service must be of the following format.
Some of these commands will in-turn be sent by the CP/PD device to its connected
counterpart over OSDP as a command/event.

For instance, if you send a LED command to a CP instance specifying a correct PD
offset, then that command is sent over to the relevant PD.

::

    osdpctl <CONFIG> send <PD-OFFSET> <COMMANDS> [ARG1 ARG2 ...]

Here, ``PD-OFFSET`` is the offset number (starting with 0) of the PD in the config
file ``CONFIG``. In PD mode, since there is only one PD, this is always set as 0.

This section will only document the ``COMMANDS`` and their arguments. You must
prefix ``osdpctl <CONFIG> send <PD-OFFSET>`` to each of these commands for
them to actually get through.

CP commands
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands can be passed to a OSDP device that is setup as a CP.
The PD to which these commands are being sent must have the capability of
executing them. Refer to the `PD capabilities document`_.
for more details.

LED
^^^

This command is used to control LEDs in a PD. It is of the format:
``led <led_no> <color> <blink|static> <count|state>``.

Examples:

::

    led 0 red blink 5        # blink LED number 0 in red color for 5 times
    led 1 amber blink 0      # blink LED number 1 in amber color forever
    led 2 green static 1     # Turn on LED number 2 green color
    led 1 blue static 0      # Turn off LED number 1 blue color

Buzzer
^^^^^^

This command is used to control Buzzers in a PD. It is of the format:
``buzzer <blink|static> <count|state>``.

Examples:

::

    buzzer blink 0          # beep the buzzer forever
    buzzer blink 5          # beep the buzzer 5 times
    buzzer static 1         # turn off the buzzer
    buzzer static 0         # turn on the buzzer

Output
^^^^^^

This command is used to control LEDs in a PD. It is of the format:
``output <output_number> <state>``.

Examples:

::

    output 0 1        # Set output number 0 high
    output 2 0        # Set output number 2 low

Text
^^^^

This command is used to control the text that is displayed on the PD. It is of
the format: ``text <string>``.

Examples:

::

    text 'Hello World'     # Set text "hello world" in display

Communication Params set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is used to set the communication parameters of a connected PD. It
is of the format: ``comset <address> <baud_rate>``.

Examples:

::

    comset 12 115200  # Set PD address to 12 and baud rate to 115200
